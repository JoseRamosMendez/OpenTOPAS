# TOPAS: Tool for Particle Simulation

## The NIH-funded TOPAS project made radiation therapy simulations using the Monte Carlo method easily accessible for the radiotherapy community. The code has been released previously as open source. This repository brings TOPAS to a new, open release stage, called OpenTOPAS. All new developments will be developed and released via this open Github repository and we invite users to help improve the code by committing (well tested) code pushes. 
## Our current focus is on expanding capabilities for radiology and emerging therapies to create an ecosystem of collaborative Monte Carlo research from therapy to imaging
